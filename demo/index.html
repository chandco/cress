                       <p>In order to keep our chefs inspired and passionate about what they do, we have provided them with some fantastic
training courses. As one example of this, a group of chefs from across our business took part in an inspiring salt
master class with Raymond Blanc at his Michelin starred restaurant, Le Manoir Aux Quat’Saisons, in Oxfordshire.
Along with our other initiatives we have been able to reduce the use of salt by 600kg over the course of a year.</p>
<p>Our Director of Food, David Cavalier, said of the course:
“It turned out to be a lively and stimulating event which sent our chefs off buzzing about how they could reduce salt without compromising flavour.”</p>
<p>In March 2012, the Government launched its Public Health Responsibility Deal with the aim to encourage
businesses and organisations to improve the health of their employees. CH&Co has voluntarily signed up to an
initial set of pledges:</p>
<ul class="cress-list">
<li>The reduction of salt in food so people eat 1g less per day by the end of 2012</li>
<li>To remove artificial trans fats by end of 2011</li>

The CH&Co car fleet is selected with reduced CO2 emissions in mind. Our fleet currently consists primarily of BMW and Mini Cooper vehicles as these perform particularly well in terms of CO2 emissions compared to other models on the market.</p>

Our supplier 3663 currently deliver grocery products, frozen products, confectionary, and janitorial products, as well
as chemicals (Ecolab products) and coffee (Paddy & Scott and vending) to our units. By utilising the 3663 vehicles
to deliver other suppliers’ products, we are reducing the number of deliveries made to sites and in turn reducing the
CO2 emissions.</p>

as well as promoting just how delicious these little known species are.</p>

                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">We encourage our sites to reduce the number of deliveries they have per week to cut down delivery miles</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">We combine small suppliers under the strength of a larger one to help reduce overall food miles<br />
<ul class="cress-inset-list">

                        <p style="font-size: 18px;">To give back to and support the wider community and society we live in.</p>
                        <p>We feel strongly about giving back to and supporting communities, both local and in some of the most deprived
areas in the world. To do so we have a number of initiatives within the business:</p>

   <p class="green-box"><strong>Kids Company Facts</strong><br />Our support to Kids Company got off to a flying start at our annual conference with every attendee bringing along supplies of non-perishable food items to donate to the cause. We were proud
to be able to deliver a true mountain of food to the Kids Company Kitchens that
week to assist in feeding children in London.</p>
                        
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class='grid_260'>
                    
                        <h2>Corporate Charity</h2>
                        <p>Every year CH&Co nominates its corporate charity,
which it supports with fundraising initiatives throughout the year.</p>
<p>For 2012/13 we have chosen Kids Company as our corporate charity, a worthy cause supporting some of the most deprived children in London through day to day support, both emotional and practical, and through provision of meals for those whose parents
are unable to feed them.</p>

<h2>Community Fact: Marys Meals</h2>
 
                        <p>Our corporate charity in 2011/12 was Marys Meals, a global movement that sets up school feeding projects in
some of the world’s poorest communities where poverty and hunger prevent children from getting an education.</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <div class='grid_260'>
            
                        
                       <p>
They provide one daily meal in a place of learning to attract poor children into a classroom where they can gain an
education. Through its fundraising initiatives CH&Co provided 183,333 meals for Marys Meals. In addition donations
of school backpacks at the CH&Co annual conference in 2011 provided 190 schoolbags for children studying with
the Marys Meals organisation.</p>
<h2>Other Initiatives</h2>
                        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Seeds for Africa.</p>
                        <p>We have our own branded water promoting our Wellbeingbeingwell initiative. With each bottle sold we are also supporting Seeds for Africa, a charity which
helps African families by providing feeds and agricultural equipment to support
long term solutions to hunger and famine. </p>
