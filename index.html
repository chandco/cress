                        <h2>Corporate Responsibility for the  Environment, Society & Sustainability</h2>
                        <p>Being a responsible corporate citizen is immensely important to us. Thatâ€™s why we have developed a detailed
strategy to guide the business, ensuring that we are considerate to the environment within which we operate,
the people with whom we engage, and the legacy our business practices will leave.</p><p> Our CRESS programme summarises our approach and inspires the business to keep setting new standards in responsible working. </p>

                        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                        <p>At CH&Co it is our mission to minimise our impact on the environment, provide an inspiring and safe place to work,
contribute towards making the world a better place, and play an active role in ensuring the industry within which we
work develops with a sustainable long term vision.</p><p> To guide our approach our CRESS programme sets out clear objectives which fall under five key areas particularly
close to our hearts:</p>
                        <ul class="home-icons">
							<li class="health"><h3>Health and Wellbeing</h3>Supporting the wellbeing of our customers and staff through healthy eating initiatives and by
raising awareness of the value of good nutrition, are both at the heart of our organisation.</li>
                            <li class="people"><h3 >People</h3>We are passionate about developing our people and helping them build successful careers with us.</li>
                           
                          <li class="suppliers"><h3 >Suppliers and Sourcing</h3>We always strive for excellence in the way we source our ingredients and products and work closely
with our suppliers to create a fair and sustainable supply chain.</li>
                           
                             <li class="environment"><h3 >Environment</h3>We care about the environment and work hard to minimise the impact we have in all that we
do as a business</li>
                           
                            <li class="community"><h3 >Community</h3>We enjoy being able to give back to and support those within the wider community and society
in which we live and work.</li>
                        </ul>
